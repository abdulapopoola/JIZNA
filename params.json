{"name":"JIZNA","tagline":"City Network Analysis Framework","body":"### Welcome to JIZNA\r\nJIZNA is a Python framework for analyzing the complexity of cities based on the dual graphs of their road networks. The platform provides an experimental framework that aims to validate a search complexity model. The search complexity model attempts to predict the difficulty of searching a city based on the city's network properties.\r\n\r\nJIZNA contains tools for the following:\r\n* Parsing and creation of object representations of openstreetmaps XML dumps.\r\n* Removal of outliers - regions that fall outside a city's geographical coordinates.\r\n* Algorithmic merging of disjointed roads in openstreetmap XML dumps.\r\n* Creation of dual graphs of city road networks.\r\n* Calculation of various metrics based on structural network characteristics.\r\n\r\nClone the repo:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/abdulapopoola/JIZNA.git\r\n```\r\n### What does JIZNA mean?\r\nNo, this is not related to the Czech city Jizna in any way.\r\n\r\nThe name was created from the initials of the lecturers and researchers who contributed to the development of the theoretical model and software platform.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The ordering of the names is of no particular significance.\r\n\r\n* J -> [Dr. Jacob Crandall](http://www.mit.edu/~jcrandal/)\r\n* I -> [Dr. Iyad Rahwan](http://www.mit.edu/~irahwan/)\r\n* Z -> [Dr. Zeyar Aung](http://www.aungz.com/)\r\n* N -> [Dr. Nicolas Stevanofitch](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=20227059&locale=en_US&trk=tyah2)\r\n* A -> [Dr. Alex Rutherford](http://scailab.org/alex.html)\r\n\r\n### What can I use JIZNA for?\r\nJIZNA can serve a variety of purposes including but not limited to the following:\r\n* The identification of potential trouble spots in cities.\r\n* Modelling city plans and resource distributions.\r\n* Predicting city complexity based comparisons to existing city models.\r\n* Merging fragmented road sections in maps\r\n\r\n### Why JIZNA?\r\nJIZNA was built as part of the requirements for my [MSc thesis](http://abdulapopoola.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/thesis1.pdf) at MASDAR.
