The dependent variable (i.e. city metrics like entropy) is plotted as is on the y axis
Plots for area and population are loglog except for the gini index which is a semilog scale; founding century is not.
Spline plots show the cities and the interpolated curve.

FIELDS
rawEntropy : Entropy of city before normalization against fully connected graph
Entropy: Normalized Entropy
cv: Coefficient of Variation
mean: Mean of unit eigenvector of centrality values
freeman_centrality: freeman centrality value for graph
gini: Gini index
stddev: Standard deviation of unit eigenvector of centrality values
